As with many open source packages, we use [GitHub](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/TransceiverToolbox) to do develop and maintain the source, and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.com/) for continuous integration.
  - If you want to just use TransceiverToolbox, we suggest using the [latest release](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/TransceiverToolbox/releases/latest).
  - If you think you have found a bug in the release, or need a feature which isn't in the release, try the latest **untested** builds from the master branch.

If you use it, and like it - please let us know. If you use it, and hate it - please let us know that too.

## Supported Tools and Releases

We provide support across two releases of MATLAB. This does not mean older releases will not work but they are not maintained. Currently supported tools are:
- Bug fixes only: MATLAB R2022a with Vivado 2021.1
- Bug fixes and new features: MATLAB R2022b with Vivado 2021.2

## Support and Documentation

All support questions should be posted in our [EngineerZone](https://ez.analog.com/sw-interface-tools) forums. Documentation is included within the toolbox but additional documentation is available on the [ADI Wiki](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/transceiver-toolbox).

## Building & Installing

If you don't want to use the toolbox installers you can manually build the toolbox. Should be a quick matter of `make build`:

```
rgetz@pinky:~/TransceiverToolbox$ make -C CI/scripts/ build 
```

Then simply add the `hdl` folder to your MATLAB path `addpath(genpath('hdl'))`
