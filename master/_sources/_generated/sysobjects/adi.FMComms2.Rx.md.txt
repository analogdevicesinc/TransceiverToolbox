The class can be instantiated in the following way with and without property name value pairs.

```matlab
dev = adi.FMComms2.Rx
dev = adi.FMComms2.Rx(Name, Value)

<span>
Unless otherwise indicated, properties are non-tunable, which means you cannot change their values after calling the object. Objects lock when you call them, and the release function unlocks them.
<br><br>
If a property is tunable, you can change its value at any time.
<br><br>
For more information on changing property values, see <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/system-design-in-matlab-using-system-objects.html">System Design in MATLAB Using System Objects.</a>

:::{dropdown} CenterFrequency
RF center frequency, specified in Hz as a scalar. The default is 2.4e9. This property is tunable.
:::

:::{dropdown} SamplingRate
Baseband sampling rate in Hz, specified as a scalar from 65105 to 61.44e6 samples per second.
:::

:::{dropdown} RFBandwidth
RF Bandwidth of front-end analog filter in Hz, specified as a scalar from 200 kHz to 56 MHz.
:::

:::{dropdown} GainControlModeChannel0
specified as one of the following: 'slow_attack' — For signals with slowly changing power levels 'fast_attack' — For signals with rapidly changing power levels 'manual' — For setting the gain manually with the Gain property 'hybrid' — For configuring hybrid AGC mode
:::

:::{dropdown} GainChannel0
Channel 0 gain, specified as a scalar from -3 dB to 71 dB. The acceptable minimum and maximum gain setting depends on the center frequency.
:::

:::{dropdown} GainControlModeChannel1
specified as one of the following: 'slow_attack' — For signals with slowly changing power levels 'fast_attack' — For signals with rapidly changing power levels 'manual' — For setting the gain manually with the Gain property 'hybrid' — For configuring hybrid AGC mode
:::

:::{dropdown} GainChannel1
Channel 1 gain, specified as a scalar from -3 dB to 71 dB. The acceptable minimum and maximum gain setting depends on the center frequency.
:::

:::{dropdown} LoopbackMode
Option to set digital loopback mode, specified as 0, 1 or 2. Allows either to digitally loopback TX data into the RX path or vice versa. Value  | Mode ---------------------------  0 |  Disable  1 |  Digital TX -> Digital RX  2 |  RF RX -> RF TX
:::

:::{dropdown} EnableQuadratureTracking
Option to enable quadrature tracking, specified as true or false. When this property is true, IQ imbalance compensation is applied to the input signal.
:::

:::{dropdown} EnableRFDCTracking
Option to enable RF DC tracking, specified as true or false. When this property is true, an RF DC blocking filter is applied to the input signal.
:::

:::{dropdown} EnableBasebandDCTracking
Option to enable baseband DC tracking, specified as true or false. When this property is true, a baseband DC blocking filter is applied to the input signal.
:::

:::{dropdown} RFPortSelect
'A_BALANCED' 'B_BALANCED' 'C_BALANCED' 'A_N' 'A_P' 'B_N' 'B_P' 'C_N' 'C_P' 'TX_MONITOR1' 'TX_MONITOR2' 'TX_MONITOR1_2'
:::

:::{dropdown} SamplesPerFrame
Number of samples per frame, specified as an even positive integer from 2 to 16,777,216. Using values less than 3660 can yield poor performance.
:::

:::{dropdown} EnableCustomFilter
Enable use of custom filter file to set SamplingRate, RFBandwidth, and FIR in datapaths
:::

:::{dropdown} CustomFilterFileName
Path to custom filter file created from filter wizard
:::

:::{dropdown} EnabledChannels
Indexs of channels to be enabled. Input should be a [1xN] vector with the indexes of channels to be enabled. Order is irrelevant
:::

:::{dropdown} uri
Hostname or IP address of remote libIIO device
:::

:::{dropdown} enIO
If true, connects to libIIO device during simulation
:::

rx.CenterFrequency = 1e9;

rx.EnabledChannels = 1;
%% Run
for k=1:10
    valid = false;
    while ~valid
        [out, valid] = rx();
    end
