Unless otherwise indicated, properties are non-tunable, which means you cannot change their values after calling the object. Objects lock when you call them, and the release function unlocks them.
<br><br>
If a property is tunable, you can change its value at any time.

Baseband sampling rate in Hz, specified as a scalar from 65105 to 61.44e6 samples per second.Help for adi.Pluto.Tx/SamplingRate is inherited from superclass ADI.AD9361.TX
:::

:::{dropdown} RFBandwidth
RF Bandwidth of front-end analog filter in Hz, specified as a scalar from 200 kHz to 56 MHz.Help for adi.Pluto.Tx/RFBandwidth is inherited from superclass ADI.AD9361.TX
:::

:::{dropdown} AttenuationChannel0
Attentuation specified as a scalar from -89.75 to 0 dB with a resolution of 0.25 dB.Help for adi.Pluto.Tx/AttenuationChannel0 is inherited from superclass ADI.AD9361.TX

:::

:::{dropdown} CustomFilterFileName
Path to custom filter file created from filter wizard
:::

:::{dropdown} EnabledChannels

```matlab

%% Configure device
tx = adi.Pluto.Tx;
tx.uri = 'ip:analog.local';

tx.CenterFrequency = 1e9;

tx.DataSource = 'DMA';
tx.EnableCyclicBuffers = true;
tx.EnabledChannels = 1;
%% Generate tone
amplitude = 2^15; frequency = 0.12e6;
swv1 = dsp.SineWave(amplitude, frequency);
swv1.ComplexOutput = true;
