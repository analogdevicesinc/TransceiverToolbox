<!-- # Analog Devices, Inc. Transceiver Toolbox -->


ADI maintains a set of tools to model, interface, and target with ADI transceiver devices within MATLAB and Simulink. These are combined into single Toolbox which contains a set of Board Support Packages (BSP). The list of supported boards is provided below.

The following have device-specific implementations in MATLAB and Simulink. If a device has an IIO driver, MATLAB support is possible, but a device-specific MATLAB or Simulink interface may not exist yet.
